  <LactineAddiction_A.label>催乳劑阿爾法成癮</LactineAddiction_A.label>
  <LactineAddiction_A.description>A chemical addiction to alpha lactine. Long-term presence of alpha lactine has caused neurological adaptations at the cellular level, so the brain can no longer function properly without the drug.
\nWithout regular doses of alpha lactine, withdrawal symptoms will begin. However, extended abstinence will force the brain to adapt back to its normal state, resolving the addiction.</LactineAddiction_A.description>
