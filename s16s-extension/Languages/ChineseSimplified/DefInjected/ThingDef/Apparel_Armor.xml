  <S16_CarbonA.description>Power armor made in the shape of a seductive suit. The seemingly exposed areas of the armor are actually covered by ultra-molecular force fields that effectively deflect bullets and melee attacks. Power armor of this model is popular among glitterworld rich who want their personal guards to be not only perfectly protected, but also look as shocking as possible.</S16_CarbonA.description>
