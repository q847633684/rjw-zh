  <Lactine.label>催乳劑</Lactine.label>
  <Lactine.description>A high-tech drug that induces lactation in humanoids, suppresses thinking and gives a feeling of mild euphoria. It was created by the aristocracy of some perverted post-industrial world to get large amounts of natural breast milk and also keep slaves obedient. Now this world is destroyed, but lactine is already widely sold on the black market.</Lactine.description>
